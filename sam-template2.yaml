 create a template for global resources
 store variable in SM parameters


 The solution is at your hands. I suggest that you do the following:

Create a separate template for the global resources (yes, I know that you don't like it, but it works well in my experience)
Store references to the shared global resources in SSM using AWS::SSM::Parameter
Deploy regional stacks and de-reference the global resources (either using Parameters, such as the AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String> or dynamic reference, e.g. {{resolve:ssm:S3AccessControl:2}})
You can use either StackSets for your regional stack deployments or create a parameterized build script that deploys the regional stacks one at the time (to be executed either locally or preferably by your CI/CD server).
